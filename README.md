# imdb-nlp-sentiment-analysis

## Overview
Sentiment analysis on movie reviews using the IMDB dataset with various neural network architectures, including RNN, LSTM, and GRU.

This repository contains a collection of Python notebooks and scripts implementing different approaches for sentiment analysis on movie reviews from the IMDB dataset. The project explores the effectiveness of various neural network architectures for this text classification task.

## Features
- Preprocessing of IMDB review text
- Implementation of word embeddings
- RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks) models with various configurations
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models
- GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) model
- Application of regularization techniques such as Dropout
- Evaluation and comparison of model performance

## Dataset
The IMDB Movie Reviews dataset contains 50,000 highly polarized movie reviews for training and evaluation. 
Reviews' sentiment is classified as positive or negative, with 25,000 reviews for training and 25,000 for testing, evenly split between positive and negative sentiments.

Prerequisites
Python 3.8+
Numpy
Pandas
Keras
Matplotlib
